THIS IS _VERY_ IMPORTANT.

When starting the ZoneEngine, you will see some changes, that is 'ISComm' (a new module).

==
ZONEENGINE WILL ONLY START WHEN LINKED WITH CHATENGINE.
==

How do I do this?

1. Start ZoneEngine, you will see something along the lines of '[ISComm] Waiting for link...'.
2. At this point, you'll wanna start ChatEngine. After a second or two, they will link with eachother and
   either a confirmation or error message will appear.
3. Do whatever you wish from here.
